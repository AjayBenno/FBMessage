# FBMessage
Repo for analyzing facebook messages in interesting ways. Currently we have 3 different methods of analysis



## Important
To get started with this, you need to go to Facebook and download your message information. Be forewarned, this can take up a while(5 days for me), so you should start this asap.
Navigate to Facebook->Settings-> Your Facebook Information -> Download your Information.

Make sure to select **Format: JSON**. You can choose to download everything or just messages. I also selected 
media quality to be low. I would recommend just downloading the messages unless you want the other data as well.

## Over Time
This method will look at a persons chat history from the start of the messaging history, and graph the number of 
messages sent per month until the current date

## Total Message Count
This will show the total number of messages/ who you've messaged the most

## Word Cloud
Displays word cloud of message history.
